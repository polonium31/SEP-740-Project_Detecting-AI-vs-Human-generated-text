# Project Title: Detecting AI-Generated vs. Human-Generated Text Using Deep Learning

The rise of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 has led to an explosion in the creation of AI-generated text. These models can produce highly coherent and contextuaxlly relevant text that can easily be mistaken for human writing.

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to distinguish between AI-generated text and human-generated text. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled examples of both types of text, we aim to build and train a model capable of identifying the origin of the text with high accuracy.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

1. **Data**: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
2. **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
3. **Results**: Stores the results and evaluation metrics obtained from the models.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the datasets in the `data` directory.
4. Run the notebooks or execute the scripts in the `models` directory.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be obtained from Kaggle. It is available at the following link: [LLM Detect AI-Generated Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/llm-detect-ai-generated-text-dataset).
